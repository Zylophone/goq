# goq

A Curated list of GoLang questions to train your algorithmic thinking muscles.

I will try to regularly update this repo.

Questions will be sorted in difficulty order (*easiest ones will have lower numbers*).

While testing the examples, my `GOPATH` will be the project root.

Contributions are always welcome.
