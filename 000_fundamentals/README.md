The codes are written to be readable, and understandable.

There are more efficient implementations of these data structures in
the literature; however, in an interview setup you’ll hardly have enough
time to implement a convoluted data structure.

Moreover, in general, one should prefer **clarity** and **readability** to
performance and efficiency at any given time. — Your goal is to write code
that humans will read.
