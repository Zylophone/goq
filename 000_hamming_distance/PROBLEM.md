## Definitions

The [Hamming distance](hamming) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

## Question

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance between them.

## Assumptions

Both numbers are within the range `[0, 231)`.

## Example

```text
x: 24
y: 11

x: 0001 1000
y: 0000 1011
      ^   ^^

Hamming distance is “3”, since 3 bits are different.
